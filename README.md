# BMconnect
Add your measures from a  Beurer blood preasure meter to your Garmin Connect account.  
Currently I only own a Beurer BM58, wich connects as HID device `ID 0c45:7406 Microdia USB Device`
There are other versions of this device available that incorporate the USB-Serial Controller `pl2303` and connect as new ttyUSB device. Support for this version is not tested, but please give it a try if you own such a device. Your feedback is higly appreciated.
